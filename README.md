# hello-world
A simple project for my graduate software engineering course.
## About me
I am a soon-to-be-full-time graduate student who works as as a consultant at an international organization. Computer science has proven enjoyable. I sometimes play games on my computer. This feels like those assignments from elementary school where we write about ourselves for every teacher.
## Also...
- I do not like most fragrances unless they are from food
- I do not like most other smells
- Dr. Fenwick probably likes Drum and Bass music like I do, but has not heard any yet
